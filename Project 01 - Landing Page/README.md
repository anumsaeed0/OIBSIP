Landing Page

## Prism Vision Blogs

This HTML and CSS project is a landing page focused on nature photography and blogging. The landing page features a visually appealing design that highlights the beauty of nature through stunning photographs and informative content.

The page starts with a top navigation bar that overlaps a header image, creating an immersive experience for visitors. The header includes a warm welcome note and a prominent link to explore further.

As users scroll down, they will find several containers showcasing different aspects of nature. These containers include captivating paragraphs and accompanying pictures featuring various elements of nature such as trees, wildlife, forests, waterfalls, and mountains. Each container provides a glimpse into the wonders of the natural world, encouraging visitors to delve deeper into the content.

One notable feature of the landing page is the fixed background image that remains visible throughout the entire scrolling experience. This creates a consistent and visually appealing backdrop for the content, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the page.

Finally, the landing page concludes with a footer that includes a copyright notice aligned to the center. This serves as a professional touch while providing necessary attribution for the content.

Overall, this HTML and CSS project offers a visually stunning and immersive experience for nature enthusiasts, combining captivating visuals, informative content, and a well-designed user interface.
